# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Each week, we will have 1- 2 meetings which will last for about 1-2 hours in person or through discord. Note will be taken.

2. **Assistance**
Use discord to contact, though not in the early morning. 9:00 - 0:00. If there is anything that goes wrong, we would be able to reply within 15- 30 minutes, as long as it is within the listed range of time. 

3. **Respect** 
Always listen to teammate's opinions and respond actively. We will use discord's reply function to make sure we know who’s responding to who.

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
The work would be mostly distributed equally throughout. While two people can be working on the functions, the others can be working on the test cases. Some functions can be harder than the others, so the amount of functions done by everyone can be different. As long as everyone is working and getting each of the parts assigned done within the time range, it will be fine with the group. v

5. **Time Commitment** 
We are looking to have 8-10 hours of work time every week for each person. If there are things that come up to someone in the group, such as midterms and finals for the week, they can let the others know beforehand. As long as the work is done within the time range, then everything would be fine. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We argue and vote on what to do if there’s disagreement. We’ll also help the part our teammate is struggling on. If any group member felt that he might not be able to accomplish their task, he should mention this in the discord so that we, as a group, could discuss how to redistribute the work to lessen his load. Habitually being late for meetings is usually caused by inconvenient meeting time. If one really feels that the meeting time isn’t convenient for him, the group can always switch to a better meeting time.
